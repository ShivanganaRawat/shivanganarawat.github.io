I am an AI/ML engineer with a passion for applying cutting-edge technologies to tackle real-world challenges. I hold a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/), where I was working under the guidance of [Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/index.html). My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and deep learning, and I've contributed to several papers published in various conferences and journals. I also had the opportunity to collaborate with [Dr. Wei Guo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/people/k0001_01967.html) from the University of Tokyo, applying deep learning techniques for high-throughput plant phenotyping.

Currently, I work as a Senior AI/ML Engineer at Stellantis, where I lead the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automotive applications to improve vehicle performance and enhance customer experience. Previously, I worked as an Applied Researcher at Fujitsu Research, contributing to innovative projects centered around generative AI.
